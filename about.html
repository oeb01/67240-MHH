                        Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Rosalyn always wanted to be nurse since she was young, so she eventually earned the title of an LPN (Licensed Practical Nurse) in 2007. Currently, she has three kids who help with the organization and continues working as a licensed practical nurse and building Minnie's Helping Hands.

            <p class="ml-5 mr-5">
                Minnie's Helping Hands is inspired by Minnie, the beloved mother of Rosalyn. Known as the neighborhood's favorite mom, Minnie never turned anyone away. Unfortunately, Rosalyn faced challenging times when she fell ill with skin cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in unemployment and financial struggle. Despite seeking assistance, she encountered rejection because of her situation.
                Motivated by her own struggles, Rosalyn envisioned creating a comprehensive human services center. Her goal was to ensure that no matter the difficulties one faced, help would be available. Recognizing that unforeseen circumstances could affect anyone, she emphasized the importance of personal growth and collective effort.
                Rosalyn believed that positive change begins with individual initiative. She emphasized that life's uncertainties shouldn't hinder progress, and even a small amount of support can elevate someone to greater heights. Minnie's Helping Hands emerged from this vision, offering assistance and fostering resilience in the face of life's challenges.
